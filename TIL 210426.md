# TIL 210426
- Took a rest over the weekend, and started on linear algebra again with revision on plotting graphs with seaborn data.

- Seems not easy to relearn linear algebra, so going really slowly by solving some math questions by hand.

# What to do tomorrow
- Focus on linear algebra
- Contact statistics professor for some queries.
