# TIL 210413

- Today, I studied Pandas. For dataframe indexing and merge, I was quite familiar with it as it is pretty similar to R. For pivot table, it is similar to Excel pivot table.
But, I might need more practice as I only used pivot table in Excel few times. It seems to be more easier to use pivot table in Python than Excel.

- Datetime data was more complicated, need more practice than any others so far. Easy part was okay with learning, but I might have to look for how datetime data is dealt.
