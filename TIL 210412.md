# TIL 210412

- Today, I learnt about Numpy from http://datascienceschool.net/intro.html. So far, Not so much difficulties as it is similar to R. 

- Though I forgot a lot of R after my national service, learning python allows me to recapitulate what I have learnt before in school and prepare for the readmission.


# What to do tomorrow

- Study further of Numpy and start on Pandas.

- Get my documents ready for readmission for the universities
