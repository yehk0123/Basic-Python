# TIL 210510
- Had family time as I do not have much time left before leaving to US for study over the weekend. Stayed away from laptop so did not manage to do what I planned. 
Today, I continued revising linear algebra from where I left, and had some calculation practice with vectors and matrix.

- Had to deal with documents for US visa, and there were lots of work. I thought I would finish this fast, but it was my mistake. I failed to manage my time and
was not able to study until where I planned.

# What to do tomorrow
- Gotta continue work on linear algebra
- Start revising working on data and plots with python as it can be forgotten really quick without consistent practice.
