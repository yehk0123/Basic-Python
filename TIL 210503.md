# TIL 210503
- While studying linear algebra with python, I felt that the previously mentioned dataschool website has not enough mathematical portion. Hence, started watching 3blue1brown
linear algebra video series which my statistics professor recommended for revision purpose. It seems like this videos give more visualization which makes easier to understand.
Nevertheless, it is still difficult topic, so I need more time to understand fully for concepts and definitions.

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue watchinig 3blue1brown videos
- Continue on linear algebra with python
