# TIL 210429
- Still working on linear algebra. Sad that I can't write anything else than that. I feel that TIL is becoming more like diary which I didn't mean it to be.
Anyway, I just feel that this is just for now, and hopefully I will have more to write when things are becoming more on coding.
For now, it is just simple coding how linear algebra calculation can be done with python adding to mathematical concepts.

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue to work on linear algebra.
