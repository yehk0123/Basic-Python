# TIL 210417

- Today, I had zoom information session for writing resume, and had chance to listen to alumni's talk on how to get a job and what is the important point when looking for a job.
It was very informative and useful, but if there is one thing that I am sorry for, there was no statistics alumni. It would have been better to listen from someone from the field,
if there were statistics alumni. Nevertheless, it was very meaningful time.

- Based on the information session, I tried to fill up and edit my resume. Hopefully, it would be better than the previous.

# What to do tomorrow
- I did not manage to do what I wrote in yesterday's what to do tomorrow. I will definitely study math using python.
