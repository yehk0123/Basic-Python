# TIL 210419
- Worked on basic Linear Algebra with numpy package. Started with basic vectors, matrix and tensor. I knew basic mathematical parts about vectors and matrix, but first
encountered with tensor. Also, even with basic knowledge about vectors and matrix, it was not easy learning with python. It might require some time to get used to.

- Was looking at distplot, but message was shown on the jupyter lab that distplot has similar features as histplot so it could be removed in the future. 
Hence, I went to internet to look about it and realised that there is better function called displot instead of histplot. It has very useful features and could use
multiple plot using displot. It was able to have 2D plot as well. I felt that if I could use the displot with flexibility, it would be very helpful.

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue studying on math using python
