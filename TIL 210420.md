# TIL 210420.md
- Continued to work on mathematics, linear algebra learning, using numpy package. Still working on basic linear algebra. It is revision on mathematics part,
but it is taking some time to digest as it was difficult class with differential equation when I took it in university. Going to learn slowly, but surely.

- Working on class scheduling for Fall 2021 with counselor. Some of classes I want are not offered in 21~22... Very disappointing

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue working on linear algebra
- Continue discussing with counselor to get a best schedule.
