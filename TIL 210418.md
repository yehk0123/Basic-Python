# TIL 210418
- Started on revision on mathematics. Had hard time studying mathematics in university before I went to navy. I expect my upcoming school life to be tougher as I forgot
lots of concepts and study materials. Going to study slowly from basic.

- Began with set theory, sequence. It looked pretty easy, but when I tried computing by hand, it was not working as smoothly as I thought. I felt again that mathematics
need to be solved by hand to practice.

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue studying mathematics
