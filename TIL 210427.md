# TIL 210427
- Worked on linear algebra. I still feel that linear algebra is not easy. I saw the part that linear algebra is used on morphing faces which was very interesting,
so I went to search on that topic and read on it. I feel that I need to spend more time on study.

# What to do tomorrow
- More work on linear algebra!
