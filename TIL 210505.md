# TIL 210505
- Started into more deeper linear algebra which requires more understanding of linear algebra with geometerical thinking. It is still hard to think linear algebra into gemoetry
as it is more like 3-dimension or even more as it is usually involving vector with more than 2-dimension. Might need more practice to get familiarized.


# What to do tomorrow
- Study progress is pretty slow, but need to go steadily. Continue with linear algebra.
