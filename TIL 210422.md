# TIL 210422
- Sadly, I am still unwell, so I focused more on thinking and brainstorming instead of sitting in front of laptop and studying. Tried to think on my future career as well as
revision on what I have done so far. Hopefully, I will feel better tomorrow for study.

# What to do tomorrow
- Focus on recovery from illness
- If feeling better, study on linear algebra with python.
