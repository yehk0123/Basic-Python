# TIL 210512
- Studied on projection and rejection of the vector and cosine similarity. When I look at the formula and try to solve the question and work on some proof, I can solve it.
However, understanding it fully seems to be different level. I had some time looking up those topics on the internet to get some better understanding, but I am still on
my way to get a full grasp of it.

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue on linear algebra
