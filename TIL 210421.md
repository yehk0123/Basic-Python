# TIL 210421
- Didn't manage to do what I planned to do due to unwell. Just got a message from counselor that it would be better to ask professor for specific statistic path question,
recommending me to ask him with specific question instead of broad question as it might take more time for him to reply and to avoid having meaningless conversation.
Hence, while resting with medicine taken, I began to think about how I should rephrase my questions that I asked counselor to be more specific and hopefully get a useful
reply from professor.

# What to do tomorrow
- Might have to look at my health condition, but will try to do what I planned to do for today.
