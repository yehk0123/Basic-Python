- Went to see the doctor to get better, and felt that maintaining good health is also very important. Just like yesterday, spent most of my time thinking what to ask to professor regarding statistics. It has to be very short and precise with very useful question that suits for my case which will eventually help me.

# What to do tomorrow
- Focus on health recovery. Get to almost 100% by the end of the weekend.
