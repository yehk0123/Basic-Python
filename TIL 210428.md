# TIL 210428
- Today, I worked on some proof questions of simple linear algebra using various laws such as distributive, associative, and commutative law to more get used to linear algebra.
Proof questions involving residual sum of squares(RSS), quadratic form and etc. I actually forgot lots of linear algebra and this seems to be working as some kind of 'memory bringer'.

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue to work on linear algebra
- To ensure not to forget about what I studied before such as plotting, keep practicing at least by little bit.
