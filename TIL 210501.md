# TIL 210501
- Continued with the linear algebra on norm, determinant, trace with proof and some calculation practice and python practice. I know I have learnt those like 5 years ago,
but it seems like 5 years is long enough to forget. I know the material with some parts with remaining missing which makes me harder to learn. Gotta take my time learning
linear algebra as it is known to be very important in statistics.

- Had email discussion with professor on program scheduling and career path. He also expressed the importance of mathematics and programming.

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue with the linear algebra
