# TIL 210523 
- For past few days, had some family time together due to my sister's holiday. Was not able to study properly, and now it's over. Going to start again! Had some revision
on the past materials as it was pretty long holiday. It is quite scary that I actually forgot a lot from just 1~2 weeks of not keeping in touch with study materials.

- Worked on some python and linear algebra.

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue working on the material
- Thinking of doing Coursera on google data analyst certificate, so search for some infomation on it
