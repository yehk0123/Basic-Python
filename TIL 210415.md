# TIL 210415
- Today, I practiced plotting various plots using data from Seaborn package. From one-dimensional data plot to multi-dimensional data plot,
some of plots such as bar plot, scatter plot, box plot were very familiar, while some of the plots such as joint plot, heatmap, catplot were not.
I felt that I need to be more familiar with various plots so that I can choose the best plot for the situation.

# What to do tomorrow
- Further study on plotting various plots and try more data from Seaborn package to practice plotting.
