# TIL 210430
- Today, I worked on properties of the matrix with norm, determinant and etc with basic practice with python and some calculation and proof by hand.

- With my days and nights changed somehow, I am feeling not well. I might have to start changing back to normal, realized that why people are working in days and sleeping at nights.

# What to do tomorrow
- Work on math again.
