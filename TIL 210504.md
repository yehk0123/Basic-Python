# TIL 210504
- Studied on system of linear equation with some practice on finding inverse matrix. It seems like lstsq() is better to use to find the least square problem's answer, x,
than using inv(). Have to remember that lstsq() is to be used by x, resid, rank, s = lstsq(A, b) in the form of Ax = b. From here resid is residual sum of squares,
rank is just rank of matrix, s is singular value.

- Using lstsq() function, tried out some examples using python
