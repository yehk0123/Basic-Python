# TIL 210414 

- Studied various plots. Some of them were very familiar, but some weren't. Bubble chart looked interesting as it could describe multi-dimensional data.

- imshow function was interesting as it can deal with image data, but it was still hard to use and understand. 

- meshgrid part was in the contour plot, and it was hard to understand. Need more understanding and practice.

- Playing with pie chart was pretty fun. The website only showed pie chart, but with curiosity, searched further and played with different function and tried making donut chart.

# What to do tomorrow
- Continue studying with various plots.

- Further study on imshow function and meshgrid part for better understanding
